SortTV

Automatically sorts TV show episodes into an organised directory structure. Can optionally move non-episodes into a separate directory. Also optional integration with xbmc (notification and library update).

Install

You need to install Perl and then save sorttv.pl where ever. Eg: on Linux into /home/[yourusername]/sorttv/

If you want to make it sort new episodes every hour:

On Linux: 
  in a console type: crontab -e
  on a new line enter "5 * * * * " followed by the command to run the script.
  This will run the script 5 mins past every hour.
  Eg:
  5 * * * * nice perl /home/cliffe/sorttv/sorttv.pl /home/cliffe/Downloads/ /home/cliffe/TV /home/cliffe/Non-episodes localhost:8089 >> /home/cliffe/sorttv/sorttv.log

  Every hour this would sort new episodes from a download directory into a sorted TV directory (if show/season sub-directories don't exist they are created), 
  moving files that are not TV episodes into a separate directory. If new episodes are moved then xbmc pops up a message informing of the new episodes and updates its library.
  For xbmc integration make sure the TV directory is setup (see the xbmc docs). Information logged to a log file.

On Windows:
  Create a .bat file with the command and use scheduler.
  Google is your friend.
